Some examples of referencing following APA: (In text)

Prior work in human-robot interaction has shown that gaze can help build effective interactions between humans and robots (Admoni and Scassellati, 2017; Broz, Lehmann, Nakano, and Mutlu, 2012; Ruhland et al., 2015). 
Admoni et al. (2016) demonstrated how to achieve effective interactions with robots using nonverbal in various domains, for example, robot tutors, robot therapists, and robot coaches. 
Huang and Mutlu (2013) developed a toolkit to generate useful social behavior for robots to achieve positive outcomes in an educational setting.
