!define RECTANGLE class

RECTANGLE "IoT Sensors" as IoT
RECTANGLE "Data Preprocessing\n(Cleaning, Normalization, aSAX)" as Preproc
RECTANGLE "ML Models" as ML
RECTANGLE "Anomaly Detection\n(Isolation Forest)" as IF
RECTANGLE "Energy Forecasting\n(LSTM)" as LSTM
RECTANGLE "Output\n(Alerts, Forecasts)" as Output
RECTANGLE "HCI Module" as HCI

IoT --> Preproc : Data (current, voltage, load)
Preproc --> IF : Preprocessed Data
Preproc --> LSTM : Preprocessed Data
IF --> Output : Anomaly Labels
LSTM --> Output : Forecasts
Output --> HCI : Results (alerts, forecasts)
